		<h3>Line integrals</h3>
		<p>
		Line integrals are useful for finding the effect of a function along a certain path.<br>
		<b>&int;<sub>C</sub> f(s) ds</b> will give the length of the path C.<br>
		For a line integral, you will need:<br>
		<b>x = f(t), y = g(t), dx/dt = f'(t), dy/dt = g'(t)</b><br>
		<b>ds/dt = &radic;<span>f'(t)&sup2; + g'(t)&sup2;</span>*</b><br>
		and then integrate <b>&int; ds dt</b> to find the length.
		</p> <p>
		Evaluate <b>&int; f(x) ds dt</b> to find the influence of the function along the length.
